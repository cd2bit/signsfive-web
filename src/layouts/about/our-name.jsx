    <p>Short answer: <em>OpenSigns</em> has been taken by a sign shop. ðŸ‘Ž</p>

    <p>
      But after weeks of exploring and bantering, we realized that the number <em>five</em>
      had been a repetitive theme, referring both to
      <a href="{http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/parameters.htm}">{'"'}Five Parameters of ASL{'"'}</a>
      and the five letters in STE(A)M. Most importantly, the sign for
      SignsFive was too cool
      to pass. For the win!
