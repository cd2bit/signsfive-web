        In early 2017, a group of deaf/hard-of-hearing/deafblind and
         hearing professionals began meeting weekly at
        <a href="https://chihacknight.org/">
         ChiHackNight
        </a>
         to discuss what issues that haven’t been addressed well.

      As a developer/engineer, Jason Salerno shared that he had been frustrated that
       the recurring problems for existing online/web sign language dictionaries for STE(A)M:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Not active anymore because there are no more grants to support or admins have moved on
      </li>
      <li>
        Not user-friendly nor mobile-friendly
      </li>
      <li>
        Not fast enough to adds signs, especially in STE(A)M field where it’s ever changing
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Initially called OpenSigns, the group hatched SignsFive, a community-sourced open to
       anyone in the sign language community to contribute, share and discuss STE(A)M signs.
