We're working to make the search for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) signs easier. In a field where new technologies and technical terms are always emerging, SignsFive will be a place where d/Deaf/HoH, interpreters and ASL students (and hearing users of ASL) can find signs for STEM terms. Led by [Jason Salerno](https://github.com/meltedspork) and internet friends.
