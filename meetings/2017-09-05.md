### Account Login

- Use OAuth to authenticate

### Process of Uploading a Video File

- Transcoding using ffmpeg to gifv. We should apply a time limit or file size limit to reduce unexpected AWS scale up. What is time limit of videos else where on the net. Group discussed 10 seconds for that
- Melissa found AWS conversion cost is 0.015/minte. 120 10-second videos fits the free tier of twenty-minutes. See [Amazon Elastic Transcoder Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/pricing/)

### Misc. Issues

- Sandy and Nick to deposit $250 at PNC or TCF Bank
- Re: survey results (currently counted at 123), Melissa and Sandy on writing 'We heard you' Medium article
- UX/UI nearly finished. Bottle-neck was video upload. Will framework allow for instant video capture? Will need to test and see. 
- Nick and RG to start creating components (e.g. nav, typography, base styles, footer)
- RG to compare cost lambda function, AWS transcoding service, and stand alone linux box
- For donate button, check PayPal, Google Wallet, Square Cash or Venmo for best way to people to gift. Or BitCoin with cool qr code. (joking but hey, donâ€™t rule it out)
