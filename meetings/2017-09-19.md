_Summary of Discussion at ChiHackNight - 9/19/17_

### Attendees: Emily W., Melissa M., Nick N., Sandy T.; Jason S. (remote pop-in)

**Summary**

- Shared feedbacks, edited and made improvements to Sandy's upcoming Medium post on survey results
- Discussed on how to have the digital world, i.e. SignsFive to reflect the physical world regarding deaf/hoh/db ownership of signs. Because SignsFive's majority of visiting audience is likely to be interpreters, SignsFive must ensure that deaf/hoh/db are the majority of content (GIFs) contributors, not interpreters, as Emily as stated:

> In their day-to-day professional practices, interpreters recognize that the d/hoh/db community has cultural ownership over sign language. This attitude must carry over and be reflected in the interactions both interpreters and Deaf users have with SignsFive.
