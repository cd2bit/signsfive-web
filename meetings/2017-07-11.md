- Discussed Users Flow

- - - 

### Both Mobile and Desktop Wireframes

- ‘Welcome’ vlog from homepage moved to ‘New Here?’ page
- `Language` option in footer postponed to post-beta version
- LinkedIn social icon added for interpreters to share signs on their professional network
- Re-label `Text/Random` for `Related` 
- In general, pick one design theme and stay with it across all platforms (e.g. Desktop Word Option C with Mobile Word Option A)

**On Word synonyms:**
For written words that sound or are written the same but different signs, we should use a short descriptor to differentiate. For example, “match these two socks” vs “ light the match”. Search results should be labeled such as “match (pair)” or “match (fire stick)”. Descriptors like that, just better.


### Mobile Wireframes

- For `Word`, default version is 'Option A' (boxes mixed sizing) while possible alternative is 'Option C' (boxes stacked vertically)
  - Idea: Combine both versions with two visual icons for users to select preference
- Add `Create` to Mobile Navbar

### Misc.

- To save time and go deeper into learning, RGCHI and Nick decided to skip VUE for alpha for React for both alpha and beta testing
- Create a small group of working interpreters to test the mobile/cloud versions
- Write an article on creating an open source database.  Never meant to compete with other existing ASL tech signs websites
- Melissa wants to write an article on the “workflow” map and moodboard
- Should ask survey respondents which social media do they use often?
